A re-implementation of android java API in python with easy access to some Android functionality like Notification,
Reading of Contacts, accessing Webview Cookies, etc...

The aim is to provide full access to Android API which can be used together with Python frameworks like:
[kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy), [kivymd](https://github.com/kivymd/kivymd), etc... Or as a standalone, in which
Android native UI is created with only python codes.

## Compiling into APK
To compile, kivy [p4a](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android) or kivy [buildozer](https://github.com/kivy/buildozer) is
required, and bootstrap must be set to `sdl2`
## Dependencies
```sh
Android min-api21
```

## Installation

```
pip install kvdroid

or

pip install https://github.com/kvdroid/Kvdroid/archive/refs/heads/master.zip # master version
# Note: this works on android only, but you can install it on your desktop for code completion assistance
```

## Buildozer Requirement
```
requirement = kvdroid

or

requirement = https://github.com/kvdroid/Kvdroid/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
```

Further notification description
```
:Parameters:
    `small_icon`: int
        The icon that appears at the top left conner of the android notification.
        Icon can be accessed by calling `get_resource(resource, activity_type=activity)`
        from kvdroid.tools module
    `channel_id`: str
        In Android, a channel ID is used to categorize and manage notifications.
        It's a unique identifier associated with a notification channel, which is
        a way to group and configure notifications in a specific way. Notification
        channels were introduced in Android Oreo (API level 26) to give users more
        control over how they receive and interact with notifications.
    `title`: str
        The title is a short, descriptive text that provides context for the
        notification's content. It's often displayed prominently at the top of the notification.
    `text`: str
        Text provides additional information related to the notification's title and
        helps users understand the purpose or context of the notification.
    `ids`: int
        The ids is an identifier used to uniquely identify a notification.
        It allows you to manage and update notifications, especially when you have
        multiple notifications displayed or want to update an existing notification with a new one.
    `channel_name`: str
        The channel_name is a human-readable name or description associated with a notification
        channel. It provides a user-friendly label for the channel, helping users understand
        the purpose or category of notifications associated with that channel.
    `large_icon`: Union[int, str, InputStream()]
        The large_icon is an optional image or icon that can be displayed alongside the
        notification's content. It's typically a larger image than the smallIcon and
        is used to provide additional context or visual appeal to the notification.
    `big_picture`: Union[int, str, InputStream()]
        the big_picture is a style of notification that allows you to display a large
        image, often associated with the notification's content. This style is
        particularly useful for notifications that include rich visual content,
        such as image-based messages or news articles.
    `action_title1`: str
        text that are displayed on notification buttons, used to also create notification
        buttons too.
    `action_title2`: str
        text that are displayed on notification buttons, used to also create notification
        buttons too.
    `action_title3`: str
        text that are displayed on notification buttons, used to also create notification
        buttons too.
    `key_text_reply`: str
        When you want to enable users to reply to notifications by entering text,
        you can use Remote Input, which is a feature that allows you to capture text input
        from users in response to a notification. key_text_reply is a symbolic
        representation or a constant used in your code to identify and process the
        user's text input when responding to notifications.
    `reply_title`: str
        text that is displayed on notification reply buttons, used to also create notification
        reply buttons too.
    `auto_cancel`: bool
        In Android notifications, the auto_cancel behavior is typically implemented by
        setting the setAutoCancel(true) method on the notification builder. When you
        set autoCancel to true, it means that the notification will be automatically
        canceled (dismissed) when the user taps on it. This is a common behavior for
        notifications where tapping the notification is expected to take the user to a
        corresponding activity or open a specific screen within the app.
    `extras`: dict
        A dictionary of string (keys) and tuple (values). Must be in this format
        ```python
        {
            "tap": (key, value),
            "action1": (key, value),
            "action2": (key, value),
            "action3": (key, value),
            "action1": (key, value),
            "reply": (key, value)
        }

        or 

        {"action1": (key, value)} or {"reply": (key, value)} or
        {"action1": (key, value), "reply": (key, value)} ...
        ```
        Extras are used to add additional data or key-value pairs to a notification.
        This allows you to attach custom data to a notification so that you can retrieve
        and process it when the user interacts with the notification
    `small_icon_color`: int
        the small_icon_color is primarily used to set the background color for the
        small icon in the notification header. It influences the color of the small
        circle that appears behind the small icon in the notification.

        Example using Color class from kvdroid.jclass.android module:
        `Color().BLUE`, `Color().rgb(0x00, 0xC8, 0x53),  # 0x00 0xC8 0x53 is same as 00C853`
    `java_class`: object
        an activity or any suitable java class
    `priority`: int
        the priority is used to set the priority level of a notification. The priority
        level determines how the notification should be treated in terms of importance
        and visibility. It helps the Android system and user to understand
        the significance of the notification.

        Here are the values that cn be used `from kvdroid.jclass.androidx` module:

        `NotificationCompat().PRIORITY_DEFAULT`:
            This is the default priority level. Notifications
            with this priority are treated as regular notifications. They are displayed in the
            notification shade but do not make any special sound or vibration. The user may see
            these notifications if they expand the notification shade.

        `NotificationCompat().PRIORITY_LOW`:
            Notifications with this priority are considered
            low-priority. They are displayed in a less prominent way and do not typically make a
            sound or vibration. They are often used for less important notifications that the user
            may not need to see immediately.

        `NotificationCompat().PRIORITY_MIN`:
            This is the minimum priority level. Notifications with
            this priority are considered the least important. They are not shown to the user unless the
            user explicitly opens the notification shade.

        `NotificationCompat().PRIORITY_HIGH:
            Notifications with this priority are considered high-priority.
            They are displayed prominently, may make a sound or vibration, and are intended to grab the user's
            attention. These are often used for important notifications that require immediate user interaction.

        `NotificationCompat().PRIORITY_MAX`:
            This is the maximum priority level. Notifications with this priority are treated as the most
            important and are displayed prominently with sound and vibration. They are typically used for
            critical notifications that require immediate attention.
    `defaults`: int
        the setDefaults() method is used to set the default behavior for a notification, such as whether
        it should make a sound, vibrate, or use the device's LED indicator. This method allows you to
        specify a combination of default notification behaviors.

        Here are the values that cn be used `from kvdroid.jclass.androidx` module:

        `NotificationCompat().DEFAULT_SOUND`: Use the default notification sound.
        `NotificationCompat().DEFAULT_VIBRATE: Make the device vibrate.
        `NotificationCompat().DEFAULT_LIGHTS`: Use the device's LED indicator (if available).
        `NotificationCompat().DEFAULT_ALL`: Use all default behaviors (sound, vibration, and LED).
    `broadcast`: bool
        sends out a broadcast message to your app to perform an action when an action button is
        clicked or reply is sent from your apps notification
:return: notification_manager

### To use system-provided fonts

:warning: `That function is so experimental. It should work for Android 7 and above but not been tested on much devices. It is actually for multilingual purposes to use system-provided fonts for no Latin languages. system_font() will always return the supported font from /system/fonts for the current device language.  Also, you could use any language-supported font from the system just by calling the system_font function with the target language's iso639-1 or iso639-2 abbreviation such as font_name = system_font('zh') or system_font('zho'). `

```python
from kivy.uix.label import Label

### To cast Java Object

```python
from kvdroid.cast import cast_object
from kvdroid.jclass.android import Uri

uri = Uri().fromFile("/home/java/my_document.pdf")
parcelable = cast_object("parcelable", uri)

# Above code  is same as below code::

from kvdroid.jclass.android import Uri
from jnius import cast

uri = Uri().fromFile("/home/java/my_document.pdf")
parcelable = cast("android.os.Parcelabel", uri)

'''
 the difference is, you dont have to remember the package name, just only the name and 
 you are good to go. This will also be helpful for python devs who do have zero knowledge on java
 
 Note:: 
 not all castable java object are included you can open an issue to include all missing 
 castables
